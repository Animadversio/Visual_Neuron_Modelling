# Visual_Neuron_Modelling
 
This repository try to model the neural response in visual cortex by features encoded in well trained CNNs.

 Features the following methods
 
 * Factorized regression model
 * Correlation feature tensor model
 * Partial least square model
 
 It provides utilities around this purpose. 
  
 * Loading experimental data, pairs of neural response and image or path to image. 
 
 
 In additions it contains analysis code for defining pixel wise objectness of an image.
 
 * Summary the correlation or weight tensor along the spatial dimensions or channel dimensions.
